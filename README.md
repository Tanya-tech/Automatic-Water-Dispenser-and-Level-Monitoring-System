# Automatic-Water-Dispenser-and-Level-Monitoring-System

This IoT project aims at making a contactless water dispenser. The IoT component in this project includes sending real time water level on a phone app.
This is done using nodeMCU's wi-fi module.

The real time water level can be seen on a blynk app that was made as a part of this project.

A few highlights of this project includes:
- Water level alert at critical levels via notification and email.
- Multiple visualizations in the blynk app for better understanding.
